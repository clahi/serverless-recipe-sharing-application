# Amazon Cognito
Amazon Cognito is a fully managed service that provides authentication, authorization, and user
management for your web and mobile applications. With Amazon Cognito, you can easily implement
features such as user sign-up, sign-in, and account recovery. It supports various authentication
methods, including user pools (for managing your applicationâ€™s own user directory) and identity
pools (for integrating with social media or enterprise identity providers). Amazon Cognito integrates
seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Amazon API Gateway, which are also part of your
serverless architecture. This integration enables you to implement serverless authentication and
authorization mechanisms for your API, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and
perform actions within your application.
